\subsection{Introduction}
The term is "Unsupervised Learning" or "Self-supervised Learning". And "Self-supervised Leaning" maybe more descriptive of what is going on. \\ \\

The main motivation for Self-supervised Leaning is that it is kind of learning that takes place in human or animals. \\ \\

The main limitation of the learning system(AI and machine learning in particular) today is the fact that we are limited to use supervised learning or reinforcement learning. Both of them are very inefficient because they requires either many many trials or a lot of data manually annotated by humans. That limits information that we can feed the machine for it to learn. \\ \\

The idea of unsupervised learning is that the machine should discover the structure of the given data as much as possible. (e.g. Children learn new visual exception very quickly because they already have elaborated internal representations mostly by observation and a little by interation.) \\ \\

How can we do it for machines? It has vary practical consequences. For example, Facebook want to translate every language to other languages. There are about 5k-7k languages. And we don't have parallel text translated from every language from others. So supervised learning doesn't work. People think about multi-lingual translator with encoder that encode text in each language into some internal representation of the meaning of the sentence and separate decoders for every language. So the problem of learning $n^2$ translator is transformed into $n$ encodes and $n$ decodes. Even so, the significant amount of training data is needed. \\ \\    

One thing that really works very well for reducing needed labeled samples to train for particular task is transfer learning. For example, in vision, you train a gigantic ConvNet on enormous amounts of data that either have been manually labeled or you train it to predict labels of free data(e.g. photos on Instagram). Then you chopped of the last layer of the network and you use the representation learned this way as input to supervised classifier for particular task.(stop at 26:50)
